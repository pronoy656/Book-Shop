            When is the best time to start promotion efforts for a manuscript or

              I believe the best time to start book promotion is when you have
              the idea for the book. Right at that time of inception, start
              talking about the book. Start sharing your thoughts via your
              social networks and/or blog.

            How can new writers (those who donâ€™t yet have many publication

              Build a community, aka a tribe, online. The best way to do that is
              by writing a blog and then interacting with other like-minded
              bloggers, website editors, ezine editors, and other book authors
              writing on your subject. These interactions should drive traffic
              to your blog where you can capture the names and emails of
              potential readers.{" "}

              The neat thing about most Internet promotion and social networks
              is that they allow book authors to interact with the world while
              remaining at their desk.{" "}
